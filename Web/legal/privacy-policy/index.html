            acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
            of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
            storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot

            me with personal information, I immediately
            delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
            and you are aware that your child has provided us with
